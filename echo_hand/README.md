# Hand Tracking for Echo
## Features :
- Mode 1: If you keep your palm open for 5 seconds facing the camera, it enters draw mode, by tracking the index finger of the hand that was used to lock for 5 seconds, and you fist it to stop from draw mode and clears what all has been draw on the board
- Mode 2: When you wipe your hand in any direction, it should copy that gesture and do a wave formation according to the gesture
- Mode 3: in Idle state (when no one is there in front of the camera for 5 seconds) it should do calm wind patterns
- Mode 4: idk how to come to this state but the bloom patern should track the pose of the person and show it on the  (but this can be avoided)
